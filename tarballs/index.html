        <h1>A Change in Plans</h1>

        <p>There used to be some downloadable tarballs containing more-or-less self-contained builds of the locker code. The lockerballs were built for distribution at OSCon 2011, and contained support binaries that were hacked up to be semi-statically linked. In other words, they were kinda busted and not meant for long-term use.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, if you want an easy way to get started with The Locker Project, there's a better solution. Assuming you have Python 2.6, Git, and a working C++ build environment, you can use <a href="https://github.com/othiym23/lockerbox">lockerbox</a>, a shell script that will download, build and install all the requisite components to give you a fully-functional environment for playing with—and extending—a locker of your own!</p>

        <p>Once you've set up a locker, you'll probably want to <a href="https://github.com/LockerProject/Locker/wiki/">check our wiki</a> for documentation on how to get started with your new locker, both as a user and as a developer.</p>
