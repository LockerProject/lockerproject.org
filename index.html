				<h2>What is the Locker Project?</h2>
				<p>A Locker gives people ownership over their personal data and clear control over how it's protected and shared. Providing flexible APIs for access to that data, Lockers are a powerful way for developers to build applications that leverage rich personal data.</p>
				<p>The Locker Project is an open source development effort, licensed under the three-clause BSD License, and sponsored by <a href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>. The core team working on the Locker Project is composed of passionate individuals who spend much of their waking (and sleeping) time thinking about personal data, identity, and the future of communication online and off.</p>
				<p>The code base of the Locker Project is primarily developed using <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a>, with a bit of Python to facilitate some integration points. We use <a href="http://npmjs.org">npm</a> to help manage internal system dependencies, and we try to follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD/BDD</a> as enthusiastically as our time will allow. Hopefully, these things will make it easy and exciting for interested developers to jump in, grok the system and start coding!</p>
				<p> To get started with local development, Lockerbox (by pib) is a straightforward way to get all the high-level dependencies installed at once. It will make a single directory called lockerbox and get everything set up inside of there.:</p>
				<pre>
    curl https://github.com/LockerProject/lockerbox/raw/master/lockerbox.sh > lockerbox.sh
    chmod 0755 lockerbox.sh
    ./lockerbox.sh
				</pre>
				When that successfully completes, add lockerbox/local/bin to your path:
				<pre>
    echo 'export PATH=$PATH:'`pwd`/lockerbox/local/bin >> ~/.profile
    source ~/.profile
				</pre>
                Then:
				<pre>
    cd lockerbox/Locker
    #check to make sure everything worked
    ./checkEnv.sh
    node lockerd.js
				</pre>
				If you encounter errors in "the fast way", or if you want to go through the process of setting everything up manually, check out the <a href="https://github.com/LockerProject/Locker/wiki/Detailed-Set-Up-Instructions">detailed set up instructions</a>.
				<img src="images/infinite_possibility.png" class="interstitial_right">
				<h3>Telehash</h3>
				<p>Soon, the Locker Project will integrate with <a href="http://telehash.org">Telehash</a>, providing fully distributed P2P communication for all lockers. Each locker can serve as a switch on the Telehash network, and maintain addressability on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia-based</a> distributed hash table that rests at the heart of the Telehash protocol. This integration will provide incredible flexibility and integrity for communication channels to and between lockers.</p>

				<h2>Vision</h2>
				<h3>Why We're Doing This</h3>
				<p>As we go through our lives we create vast amounts of data. Emails, phone calls, social network posts, photos, utility bills, health monitoring devices, text messages, browsing data, purchase receipts and more are all born out of the regular course of our actions.  It's more than just data.  It represents our actions, interests, intentions, communications, relationships, locations, behaviors and creative and consumptive efforts.</p>
				
				<p>Currently, our data is scattered everywhere. It lives in and is usually owned by the various networks into which it was created or exchanged. It's aggregated by third party trackers and targeters looking to deliver advertising, content and services to you. Billions of dollars are exchanged, industries built upon and value created off of our data, and it serves as the basis and is the foundation for some of the largest power structures on the web, and in the world at large.</p>
		
				<p>Meanwhile, the people who have benefited least from this ecosystem are the very people originating the data. Often times, in fact, these channels and organizations go out of their way to limit our ability to extract our data from the network and reuse our own content.  Limitless opportunities for engaging personalized applications and web experiences, as well as more free and open communication are lost when this happens.</p>
				
				<h3>How Lockers Work</h3>		
				<p>Lockers are systems that allow people to collect all of their data into one resource that they truly own. Even the code base of the Locker Project is open source, ensuring that people can run their lockers as they see fit, where they see fit.</p>
		
				<p>By using a rich system of connectors and collections, lockers make it possible to access and aggregate personal data, even when no traditional web API exists for the source. Interactions between lockers, applications, data and services are encrypted and secured via a highly secure protocol and system of authorization. Singly is working with experts and thought-leaders throughout the industry to provide open solutions to ensuring robust security for these personal data systems. This allows for even sensitive data to be safely included in a locker and made available for a person at all times.</p>
				
				<h3>What is Singly?</h3>
				<p>Data ownership alone doesn't solve the problem of providing discrete value to a person. To deliver real and actionable value, Singly is sponsoring the open source project's development and further extending the Locker Project's trust and authentication ecosystem to enable application developers to build powerful products on top of personal data. We are looking to solve the parallel problems of developers' access to and maintenance of personal data and individuals' needs for data ownership and security, enabling a whole new class of valuable interactions between people, their data and creative developers world-wide.</p>

				<h2>Ecosystem</h2>
				<p>The Locker Project does not exist in a void, but rather is part of a thriving ecosystem of policy, systems and technology designers working to improve the state personal data ownership and usage, identity, and context generation and exchange.</p>
				
				<p>Some of the key players in this space include the <a href="http://personaldataecosystem.org/">Personal Data Ecosystem Consortium</a>, the <a href="http://www.idcommons.net/">Identity Commons</a>, <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/projectvrm">Project VRM</a> and others.</p>
